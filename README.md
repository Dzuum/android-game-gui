# Android hybrid game GUI


<h2>About</h2>
The beginning of an Android game, programmed for the course UI Programming during the <b>autumn of 2015</b>. No real gameplay, just the initial GUI. The vision of the game is a hybrid of tower defense, real-time strategy and role-playing game. At the moment no real game logic is present.<br><br>
During the creation I learned how to operate the <b>LibGDX</b> library and some <b>Android</b> things.
